The game loop runs until the 'x' button is pressed, at which point it stops.  The display attempts to draw but nothing happens.

Basically, a bunch of IGetDeleted objects get created and start moving in the -1 x direction.  These objects are spectral and go forever until receiving an out event upon which they reset position. Upon receiving enough step events, these objects delete themselves.

The EndOfWorlds object takes in a velocity and tries to move in that direction.  I have it set up that there are two, so they collide and do not end up moving.  It also has a keyboard event response, and pressing x ends the game.
